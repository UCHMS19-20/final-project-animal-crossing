# **Olivia Qiu's Final Tech Project** - Animal Crossing: Magnet Edition

## Description
  My game is heavily based on the Nintendo game series *Animal Crossing*. In *Animal Crossing*, the player is the mayor of a town in which all the villagers are animals. The purpose of the game is to acquire and decorate a house, develop the town, and make friends with the villagers of your town.

  My version of the game features less gameplay than the real *Animal Crossing*, but some parts (like the art and the characters) are the same! 

  The purpose of my game is to become valedictorian of Magnet, but you discover that you have Fs in every single class! You seek out Mrs. Gerstein (who looks eerily similar to the character Isabelle from the original *Animal Crossing* game), who tells you that you need to complete tasks for teachers in order to raise your grades. These tasks turn out to be collecting fruit! You must then deliver the correct fruit to each teacher, which will raise your grade to an A and give you a chance at becoming valedictorian!
